#+TITLE: ztk -- header only implementation of Z/Z_2^K arithmetic

~ztk~ is a header only library which implements support for arithmetic on the
ring Z/Z_2^K for ~K <= 128~.

In addition, ~ztk~ also has support for the specific Galois Ring ~GR(2^K, 4)~;
i.e., the degree 4 exntension of Z/Z_2^K.

** TODOs

   - Documentation for ~GR4~ and ~GR~.
   - Examples of how how to use ~ztk~ (for now, see the code in ~test/tests.cpp~).
   - Wider Galois ring support.
   - Non-broken benchmarks.
